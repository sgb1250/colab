Use BigQuery via magics
The google.cloud.bigquery library also includes a magic command which runs a query and displays the result, optionally saving it to a variable as a DataFrame.

SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_rows

Use BigQuery through Pandas
Pandas GBQ Documentation

The GSOD sample table contains weather information collected by NOAA, such as precipitation amounts and wind speeds from late 1929 to early 2010.

Sample approximately 2000 random rows
[ ]

import pandas as pd
​
sample_count = 2000
row_count = pd.io.gbq.read_gbq('''
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total
  FROM [bigquery-public-data:samples.gsod]''', project_id=project_id, verbose=False).total[0]
​
df = pd.io.gbq.read_gbq('''
  SELECT
    *
  FROM
    [bigquery-public-data:samples.gsod]
  WHERE RAND() < %d/%d
''' % (sample_count, row_count), project_id=project_id, verbose=False)
​
print('Full dataset has %d rows' % row_count)

Describe the sampled data
[ ]

df.describe()

View the first 10 rows
[ ]

df.head(10)

[ ]

# 10 highest total_precipitation samples
df.sort_values('total_precipitation', ascending=False).head(10)[['station_number', 'year', 'month', 'day', 'total_precipitation']]
